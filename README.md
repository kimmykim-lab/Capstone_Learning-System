# Capstone Learning System

An AI-supported Learning Analytics architecture designed to transform structured reading into measurable conceptual growth.

This project was developed as part of the UW MLIS Capstone and explores how structured knowledge input, concept validation, and mastery tracking can be integrated into a scalable learning system.

## 1. Project Overview

Capstone Learning System is a structured learning architecture that integrates:

- Daily structured knowledge input
- Concept-level quiz validation
- Mastery tracking
- Weekly trajectory modeling
- Reflection-based learning logs

This is not a content platform.
It is a learning analytics system that models how understanding evolves over time.
