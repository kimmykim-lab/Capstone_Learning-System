# Learning Analytics – Self-Evolving Learning System

## 1. Core Philosophy

Future learning is not about accumulating knowledge.
It is about learning how to ask better questions.

This Learning Analytics module is designed to track:
- Interest evolution
- Question abstraction level
- Concept density growth
- Scaffold progression

This is not an evaluation system.
It is a cognitive growth tracking system.

## 2. System Structure

The Learning Analytics module operates on five layers:

1. Daily_Logs  
   - Conversation summaries (ChatGPT, Gobi)
   - Reflection notes
   - Emerging interests

2. Analysis  
   - Keyword frequency detection
   - Repeated concept tracking
   - Question-type classification
   - Abstraction level estimation

3. Question_Evolution  
   - Weekly question collection
   - Depth comparison
   - Pattern shift analysis

4. Scaffold  
   - Suggested next-level concepts
   - Adaptive learning direction
   - Interest-based progression

5. Outputs  
   - Concept Map (Mind Map format)
   - Weekly Learning Trajectory
   - Interest Clusters

## 3. Data Flow

Daily Conversation  
→ Structured Extraction  
→ Weekly Aggregation  
→ Visualization  
→ Scaffold Suggestion  

---

## 4. Visualization Strategy

### Concept Map
Mind-map style network visualization.
Central node: Learning
Clusters represent dominant interests.
Edge density represents concept connections.

### Weekly Trajectory
X-axis: Time (Week)
Y-axis: Question Abstraction Level
Tracks growth of inquiry depth.

## 5. Intended Outcome

The system should:
- Identify recurring intellectual themes
- Detect shifts in cognitive focus
- Measure question sophistication
- Provide adaptive scaffold suggestions

This is a prototype of a self-adaptive learning intelligence system.
