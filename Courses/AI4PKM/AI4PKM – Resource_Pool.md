# AI4PKM – Structured Resource Guide

## Course Overview

AI4PKM explores how artificial intelligence can support personal knowledge management systems.

The course focuses on:
- Structuring knowledge
- Automating learning workflows
- Modeling reflection and growth over time

Learning in this course is treated as cumulative growth, not as static evaluation.
